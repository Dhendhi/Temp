# Chapter 21: Talons
*Source: The Book of Many Things, p. 175* 

This chapter presents monsters inspired by the [Deck of Many Things](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/deck-of-many-things.md), arranged in alphabetical order. For guidance on how to use a creature's stat block, consult the "introduction" of the "Monster Manual". Some creatures have weapons with unusual damage types or spellcasting that functions in an atypical way. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses its weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or spell functions for a different creature.

If a stat block contains the name of a class in parentheses under the creature's name, the creature is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.
